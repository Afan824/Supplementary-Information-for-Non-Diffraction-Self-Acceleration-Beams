1) For the case of generating two-dimensional (2D) Airy beam, the specific height information and phase information of meta-structure model is contained in the Table file Airy beam information.xls, which also includes Fourier phase, cubic phase and total phase information required to generate 2D Airy beam. 
2) For the case of generating Bessel-like curved beam, the specific height information and phase information of meta-structure model is contained in the Table file Bessel beam information.xls which also includes the solution of Z in the calculation step.
